# Fluent KVS

The Fluent KVS is a cloud-native, elastic, tiered storage engine. To build and run the Fluent KVS on your local machine, please run `./scripts/build-kvs.sh` followed by `./scripts/start-kvs-local.sh` from the project root directory.

**TODO**: Add a longer description here. Also describe how to run just the KVS in Kubernetes.
